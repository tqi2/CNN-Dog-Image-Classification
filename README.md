# CNN-Dog_Image_Project

# Overview
The second project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, I will explore state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied dog images. Given an image of a dog, my model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, just for fun, my code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# Data
The training data for this project is located [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). This dataset contains 133 different breeds of dogs and is already split into train, test, and validation sets. Place the training, testing, and validation datasets in the `dogImages` folder.

# Environment
Python: Python 3.6
PyTorch: 
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M
Windows: 8.1

# Result
Using the pretained , transfer learning on new dog image data for 3 hours with , the models has % accuracy on test data.
