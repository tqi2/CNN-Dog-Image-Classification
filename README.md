# CNN-Dog_Image_Project

# Overview
The second project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, I will explore state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied dog images. Given an image of a dog, my model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, just for fun, my code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# Data
The training data for this project is located [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). This dataset contains 133 different breeds of dogs and is already split into train, test, and validation sets. Place the training, testing, and validation datasets in the `dogImages` folder.

# Environment
Python: 3.6

PyTorch: 0.4.0

GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M

Windows: 8.1

# Result
With the pretained Resnet50, I used transfer learning on new dog image data, the models has 75% accuracy on test data for dog breed with only 5 epochs of training (took less than 10 mins). The final user app using the VGG16 as a dog detector, then use the retrained Restnet50 as dog breed classifier, for huamans, I used OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images.

I tried photo of myself, it shows I look like a Bull terrier, and trump looks like Greyhound

# Deliverable
Check the dog_app.ipynb for model with detail in code.

Check myphotos for the photos I tried with my app.
